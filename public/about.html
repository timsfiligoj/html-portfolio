 <h1>About Me</h1>
 <img src="../assets/images/marathon.JPG" height="400" alt="Tim & Tom after finishing 2023 Ljubljana Marathon">
 <p>Tim is a genuinely hardworking person who wakes up at 3:50 am (hence his business name 350life) in order to get the most out of the day. He believes that finishing the most difficult predictable task before 7:00 am (or getting the first client's e-mail) leads to a much higher productivity.</p>
 <p>As a masters student of marketing & sales he is deeply passionate about human behaviour. Rather then exploiting human flaws, he uses insights for creating the best possible user experience for variety of web and mobile apps.</p>
 <p>He believes in empathy and is always ready to help other people find motivation when 'the going gets tough'.</p>
